# OpenURL link resolver sampler

See monday.com ticket [Write script for testing sample OpenURLs](https://nyu-lib.monday.com/boards/765008773/pulses/3386819884).
This ticket calls for the creation of two components: a sampler which fetches and saves
the responses from various services to OpenURL queries, and an analyzer which generates
reports comparing the service samples.
This project is the sampler component.  The analyzer and report generator will be
developed in a separate repo.
